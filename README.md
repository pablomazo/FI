The minimal generating sets (fundamental invariants) of invariant rings of symmetric groups for molecular systems.


# FI routines for FORTRAN90

Inputs the distance between the system points and returns the FI for the given 
permutational group.

The fundamental invariants have been obtained using 
[Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
