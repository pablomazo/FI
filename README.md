The minimal generating sets (fundamental invariants) of invariant rings of symmetric groups for molecular systems.



Inputs the distance between the system points and returns the FI for the given 
permutational group.

FI included by [Pablo del Mazo](https://github.com/pablomazo/) have been obtained using
[Singular](https://www.singular.uni-kl.de/).
